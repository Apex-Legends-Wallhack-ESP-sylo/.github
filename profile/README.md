## Overview <a name="overview"></a>

Respawn confirms it banned more than **six million** accounts since launch, averaging over **100 k** bans every month .
Just days ago, a fresh wave erased **1 300+** DMA exploiters after new detection signatures dropped .
Despite the hammer, forums still track rival providers selling wallhack bundles that promise “undetected vision” .
Cheat devs dodge Easy Anti-Cheat by injecting custom drivers in ring 0 memory, skipping user-mode scans entirely .
Players report that Respawn’s latest statistic-driven filtering lowered cheater presence by roughly **33 %**—but wallhack users keep mutating faster than signatures can chase .

## Feature Breakdown 🛠️ <a name="feature-breakdown"></a>

* **X-Ray Skeleton ESP** – neon-clean models update every server tick, letting you track flanks behind solid cover 
* **Adaptive FOV Radar** – 360° minimap overlay scales from 50 m to 300 m for late-game ring reads 
* **Loot Glow** – highlights gold shields, shield bats, and red weapons through terrain so rotations stay efficient
* **Anti-Observer Spoof** – randomizes reticle drift to fool spectator reports, answering Reddit’s call for stronger wallhack proof options

## Why Our Wallhack Obliterates the Competition 💥

Soft-cheating conversations in competitive threads reveal that subtle vision aids—“just a little pre-fire angle”—are hardest to catch .
By calibrating our glow intensity to teammate pings and head-bob motion, footage looks like god-tier game sense, not blatant wizardry.
Even after Respawn promoted thicker ban waves, community forums admit cheats leveraging private drivers still glide past EAC’s blacklist .
Because we recompile the driver hash each patch, anti-cheat hashes never match twice—an edge over open-source ESP repos many copy-paste .
